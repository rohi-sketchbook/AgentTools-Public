# Security Policy

Codex Discord Connector can execute shell commands and expose local workspace output through Discord. Treat it as a powerful local administration tool, not as a public bot.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are handled on the latest published npm version and the default branch until a stable release policy is documented.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability that exposes tokens, local files, command execution, or Discord access controls. Report privately to the maintainer listed on the npm package or repository.

Include:

- A short impact summary.
- Reproduction steps.
- Affected version or commit.
- Whether a Discord token, workspace file, or shell command path is involved.

## Threat Model

The connector runs commands on the machine where it is installed. Anyone who can send authorized commands in a configured Discord channel may be able to run local shell commands with the permissions of that local user.

The recommended deployment is Direct mode, where the Discord bot runs on the same computer it controls. Direct mode has the smallest deployment surface and is the primary supported path.

Hub mode is an experimental multi-computer option. It adds a Control API and Local Agent websocket path so one Discord bot can reach multiple computers. Treat Hub mode as higher risk: it expands the network attack surface, increases the number of credentials and runtime processes to protect, and can fan out operator mistakes across more machines.

Use it only with:

- Private Discord servers you control.
- Explicit Discord role allowlists.
- Trusted operators.
- Workspaces where Discord-visible output is acceptable.

Do not connect it to public or community servers.

For Hub mode, also require:

- No direct public-internet exposure for the Control API.
- Firewall, VPN, localhost tunnel, or equivalent network access control.
- Separate review of every connected computer's workspace root.
- Minimal operator roles and periodic role membership review.
- Test-only or low-sensitivity machines until you have audited your deployment.

## Secrets

Never commit or publish:

- `.env`
- `.connect/config.json`
- `.connect/state.json`
- Discord bot tokens
- local database files
- logs containing command output
- Codex session or transcript files

If a Discord token is exposed, rotate it immediately in the Discord Developer Portal and restart the connector.

## Shell Execution

Shell commands run with the local user's permissions. The connector includes role checks and dangerous-command confirmation, but it is not an operating-system sandbox.

Recommended controls:

- Use a dedicated Discord role for operators.
- Grant the bot only the Discord permissions it needs.
- Run the connector from a dedicated workspace root.
- Avoid running as an administrator/root user.
- Review command output before sharing logs.

## npm Package Hygiene

Before publishing:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
npm pack --dry-run
```

Review the `npm pack --dry-run` file list and confirm that no local config, state, tokens, logs, databases, or session transcripts are included.
